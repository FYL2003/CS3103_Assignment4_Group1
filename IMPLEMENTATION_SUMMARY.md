# Metrics Abstraction Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation abstracts the metrics calculation logic and certificate generation from `server.py` into the `GameNetAPI` class, providing a cleaner architecture and better separation of concerns.

## Key Changes

### 1. ChannelMetrics Class (GameNetAPI.py)
**Location**: Moved from `server.py` to `GameNetAPI.py`

**New Features**:
- `highest_seq`: Tracks the highest sequence number seen
- `received_seqs`: Set of all received sequence numbers for gap detection
- `calculate_pdr()`: Calculates Packet Delivery Ratio based on sequence gaps

**Benefits**:
- Centralized metrics logic in the API layer
- Accurate PDR calculation that detects packet loss
- Reusable across different server implementations

### 2. Certificate Generation
**Before**: Server manually called `ensure_certificates()` before creating API
```python
self.certfile, self.keyfile = ensure_certificates(certfile, keyfile)
self.api = GameNetAPI(isClient=False, host=host, port=port, 
                      certfile=self.certfile, keyfile=self.keyfile)
```

**After**: API handles certificate generation internally
```python
self.api = GameNetAPI(isClient=False, host=host, port=port, 
                      certfile=certfile, keyfile=keyfile)
```

**Benefits**:
- Simpler server initialization
- Certificate management encapsulated in API
- Consistent behavior across all API users

### 3. Metrics Methods in GameNetAPI

#### get_statistics_summary(delivered_packets_count)
Returns a dictionary containing:
- Overall statistics (runtime, total arrivals, throughput)
- Channel-specific statistics for both RELIABLE and UNRELIABLE
- Latency metrics (avg, min, max RTT)
- Jitter metrics (avg, min, max)
- Throughput (Kbps, KBps)
- Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR%)

#### print_statistics(delivered_packets_count, out_of_order_count)
Displays formatted statistics report including:
- Overall statistics section
- Channel-specific statistics section
- Ordering statistics section

**Benefits**:
- Consistent statistics format across applications
- Easy to extend with additional metrics
- Can be called programmatically or for display

### 4. Connection Termination Callback
**New Feature**: Automatic statistics display when client disconnects

**Implementation**:
1. GameServerProtocol detects `ConnectionTerminated` event
2. Triggers `on_connection_terminated` callback
3. Server displays statistics automatically
4. Server continues running for new connections

**User Experience**:
- No need to press Ctrl+C to see statistics
- Statistics shown after each client session
- Server stays alive for multiple test runs

### 5. Improved PDR Calculation

**Old Formula** (Incorrect):
```python
pdr = (packets_received / packets_delivered) * 100
```
Problem: Both values are the same on receiver side

**New Formula** (Correct):
```python
expected_packets = highest_seq + 1
pdr = (packets_received / expected_packets) * 100
```
Benefits:
- Detects packet loss by tracking sequence number gaps
- Shows expected vs received packet counts
- Accurate even with high packet loss

**Example**:
```
Sent sequences: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Received sequences: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (missing 3, 6)

Expected: 10 packets (0-9)
Received: 8 packets
PDR: 80.00%
```

## Assignment Requirements Met

✅ **Point (c)**: GameNetAPI handles packet reception and delivery  
✅ **Point (g)**: Comprehensive logging with SeqNo, ChannelType, Timestamp, RTT  
✅ **Point (h)**: Network testing documentation (NETWORK_TESTING.md)  
✅ **Point (i)**: Metrics measured separately for both channels:
- Latency (RTT) - Average, Min, Max
- Jitter (RFC 3550) - Average, Min, Max  
- Throughput - Kbps and KBps
- Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) - Percentage

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
- ✅ ChannelMetrics PDR calculation (0%, 20%, 50%, 100% scenarios)
- ✅ GameNetAPI metrics initialization
- ✅ Statistics summary generation
- ✅ All test cases pass

### Code Quality
- ✅ Code review: No issues found
- ✅ CodeQL security scan: No vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ All Python files compile successfully

## Usage Examples

### Server-side Metrics Access
```python
# During operation
api.metrics['RELIABLE'].packets_received
api.metrics['UNRELIABLE'].calculate_pdr()

# Get statistics summary
stats = api.get_statistics_summary(delivered_packets_count=100)

# Display formatted report
api.print_statistics(delivered_packets_count=100, out_of_order_count=5)
```

### Automatic Statistics Display
When client disconnects, server automatically displays:
```
====================================================================================================
CLIENT CONNECTION TERMINATED
====================================================================================================

====================================================================================================
H-QUIC RECEIVER STATISTICS
====================================================================================================

OVERALL STATISTICS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total Runtime:              30.45 seconds
  Total Packets Received:     580
  Total Packets Delivered:    580
  Total Bytes Received:       45,230 bytes
  Overall Throughput:         11.88 Kbps

CHANNEL-SPECIFIC STATISTICS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  RELIABLE Channel:
    Packets Received:         290
    Packets Delivered:        290
    
    Packet Delivery:
      Expected Packets:       295
      Received Packets:       290
      Delivery Ratio:         98.31%
      
  UNRELIABLE Channel:
    ... (similar format)

====================================================================================================
Server continues running - waiting for new connections...
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
====================================================================================================
```

## Network Testing

See `NETWORK_TESTING.md` for detailed instructions on:
- Using tc-netem (Linux) for network emulation
- Using Clumsy (Windows) for network emulation
- Using Mininet for advanced topology testing
- Test scenarios for low loss (<2%) and high loss (>10%)
- Expected metrics output format

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (server.py handles everything):
```
server.py
├── ChannelMetrics class
├── Certificate generation
├── Metrics calculation
├── Statistics printing
└── Packet processing
```

### After (abstracted into API):
```
GameNetAPI.py
├── ChannelMetrics class (with PDR calculation)
├── Certificate generation (_ensure_certificates)
├── Metrics tracking (metrics dict)
├── Statistics methods (get_statistics_summary, print_statistics)
└── Connection callbacks

server.py
├── ReceiverApplication (simplified)
└── Packet processing and logging
```

**Benefits**:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: API handles protocol logic, server handles application logic
2. **Reusability**: Metrics logic can be used by any application using GameNetAPI
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to metrics calculation only affect GameNetAPI
4. **Testability**: Can test metrics independently of server implementation
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new metrics or modify existing ones
